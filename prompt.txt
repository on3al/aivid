Create a 45-second narrated story about a cowboy western comic in JSON format. The story should be broken into 2 distinct scenes, each with a `scene_number`, `scene_description`, and `narration`. 
Each scene should be entertaining and flow into the next with the first scene being an intro and the last a conclusion that create a cohesive story, that could be listened to in a seamless loop

Please ensure that the descriptions and narrations do not contain graphic violence, blood, or other content that might violate content policies. 



The JSON structure should look like this:
{
  "title": "some intriguing title",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "scene_description": "some description",
      "narration": "some very intrigueing narration that will take 5-10 seconds when converted to audio"
    },
     {
      "scene_number": 2,
      "scene_description": "some description",
      "narration": "some very intrigueing narration that will take 5-10 seconds when converted to audio"
    },
    ...
    {
      "scene_number": n,
      "scene_description": "some description",
      "narration": "some very intriguing narration that will take 5-10 seconds when converted to audio"
    },
  ]
}

Each scene should have a detailed description and a corresponding narration that would be used for both image generation and text-to-speech. Keep the overall story concise but dramatic, suitable for a 45-second TikTok video.
