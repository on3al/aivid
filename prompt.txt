Create a 45-second narrated story about a famous Greek myth in JSON format. The story should be broken into 3 distinct scenes, each with a `scene_number`, `scene_description`, and `narration`. Focus on a key moment in Greek mythology, such as the tale of Theseus and the Minotaur.

Please ensure that the descriptions and narrations do not contain graphic violence, blood, or other content that might violate content policies. 



The JSON structure should look like this:
{
  "title": "some intriguing title",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "scene_description": "some description",
      "narration": "some very intriguing narration that will take 5-10 seconds when converted to audio"
    },
     {
      "scene_number": 2,
      "scene_description": "some description",
      "narration": "some very intriguing narration that will take 5-10 seconds when converted to audio"
    },
    ...
    {
      "scene_number": n,
      "scene_description": "some description",
      "narration": "some very intriguing narration that will take 5-10 seconds when converted to audio"
    },
  ]
}

Each scene should have a detailed description and a corresponding narration that would be used for both image generation and text-to-speech. Keep the overall story concise but dramatic, suitable for a 45-second TikTok video.
